A modified version of Smoothieware, made specifically for Readybox.
A simplifed interface makes it easier for first time printers.


== Set up
See http://smoothieware.org/eclipse for instructions on setting up the IDE.

Once the prokject is built, copy the file LPC1768/main.bin to the sdcard, renaming it to firmware.bin and reboot the Readybox to flash the new firmware automatically.
